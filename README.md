#   _Hello !_
### _I am Asha._ ###
####_I am a French teacher , but now I am working as a sales consultant_####
####_I worked at TFA and Normed LLC and I have 7 years of volunteer work experience in different camps._####
#### _ Now a little bit about my hobbies. I am an ordinary Armenian girl, who adores nature and her country._ ####
#### _I like listening to the music and reading._ ####
#### _The education is really important for me, I think that everyone should strive to self-educate for continuous growth._ ####
#### _So, languages, art, literature, astronomy, programming and sometimes politics are interesting fields for me._####
####_For me , a person's value system is in the first place!_####
####_I like to visit different sightseeings, but wherever I go, my favorite place is my birthplace Lori, where the nature is wonderful, the air is clear, the night sky is full of stars and the people are kind and hospitable_####
